For this assignment, we were tasked with evaluating the UK Food Standards Agency data regarding restaurant quality throughout the United Kingdom. These evaluations resulted in a food hygiene rating, as well as scores for the building's structural integrity and confidence in management. For this homework scenario, "You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles."

First, we conducted our imports and created an instance of MongoClient. Then we set up the UK Food database, and the establishments collection within the database. Once we had out collection, we added information about a new restaurant called Penang Flavours. This restuarant has not been rated bu the agency yet. We then used the 'find_one' function to find the Business Type Id for Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen. Then we eliminated the Dover Local Authority from the databse using the 'delete_many' function. We converted latitude and longitude to decimal, and  converted RatingValue to integer, This concluded the setup portion of  this assigment.
